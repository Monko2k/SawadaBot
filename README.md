## Planned Features
- quick match gamemode 
- randomized teams/mappools gamemode
- mappool practice mode
- regular match gamemode
- map draft mode
- other freaking gamemodes!!!!
- direct custom mappool upload
- maybe a site to host/display mappools? 
- custom freemod rules

## Things That Need Fixing
- currently bot can't detect player mods, dunno why
- I have no idea how many lobbies I'm allowed to run at once on my account
- currently discord embed footers are set with a deprecated method, but I cba to figure out how else to add them 
- for some reason the lobby timeout timer doesn't always get paused on map start
- a bunch of the pools have deleted maps
- Nothing is well tested
